#### Description
As you may have heard, the CERN EP department is launching a research
and development programme on detector hardware, electronics and software
for new experiments and detector upgrades beyond the LHC phase II:

    https://ep-dep.web.cern.ch/rd-experimental-technologies
    Kick-off meeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/677108/

As part of the HEP software community, we are encouraged to set the
scene on essential future technologies that we need to harness and
develop in order to meet the computing challenges that arise on the
horizon of the next 5-10 years.  We are asked to provide a convincing
case for a dedicated software R&D programme that accompanies the next
generation of accelerators and detectors.  Given the decline of Moore's
law, a growing stack of complex software to maintain, and projected
event rates and complexities far beyond na√Øve scaling, we should aim at
identifying the technology seeds that bring the potential for
transformational change. The final goal of this activity is a report
that will be produced by this Autumn, with our Software R&D proposal
included. Although the activity is centred around CERN EP participation
of all HEP software experts is very welcome

A first EP wide workshop discussing possible R&D lines will be organised
soon, on March 16, 2018.  In order to foster the scientific discussion,
we would like to warmly invite you to an open software R&D lighting talk
session:

    Feb 5, 2018 <https://indico.cern.ch/event/699252/>

For this session, open to everyone, we envisage an "open mic" with 5-10
minutes gigs that would sketch one future software R&D line in a few
slides (3!). Please feel free to let your thoughts wander and propose
some daring avenues of exploration!  You might find inspiration in the
HSF Community Roadmap <https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982>, the OpenLab
white paper on future challenges
<http://openlab.cern/publications/technical_documents/cern-openlab-white-paper-future-it-challenges-scientific-research>,
or past editions of the software technology forum
<https://indico.cern.ch/category/7857/>.

A few guiding questions could be:

  o) What would be the physics motivation for a particular technology to
be developed?
  o) What new technologies might we be obliged to use in the future?
  o) Would there be a concrete piece of software that to be expected in
the next 2 years?
  o) Is there an educated guess about the potential of the technology in
the next 5 years?
  o) Is there reason to believe that we can carry out the R&D work
roughly within the current resource envelope?

Possible themes could include, but are of course not limited to

  o) A HEP algorithm toolbox for computing accelerators (GPU, TPU, FPGA,
perhaps even quantum computing devices)
  o) Machine learning for analysis, fast simulation, I/O tuning; error
estimation and predictable system behavior
  o) Turn-key systems for future experiments; framework modularization
and ready-made analysis facilities
  o) High-level programming paradigms and abstractions; declarative
programming, software correctness guarantees, domain-specific languages,
etc.

Please let us know if you would like to contribute a lightning talk. At
the end of the session we will have a general discussion on the best way
to proceed in the group.

For discussion and for any questions, please don't hesitate to contact
us under EP-RDET-WG7-Software@cern.ch. Feel free to forward this
announcement to relevant people in our community.
