#### Description
This is a self-organized Hackathon, taking place from Tuesday May 22 to Friday May 25, at the Idea Square, CERN, Geneva.

These hackathons are open to all members of CMS, self-organised in small groups of 2-5 people.
The goal is to brainstorm, debug, develop and improve well-defined algorithms or pieces of code, sharing ideas and knowledge, away from emails, meetings and other distractions.

Industry experts may sometimes be available to help with specific topics.

Past topics ranges from code optimisation on CPUs, development of reconstruction algorithms and frameworks on GPUs, to machine learning for different aspects of the experiment.
