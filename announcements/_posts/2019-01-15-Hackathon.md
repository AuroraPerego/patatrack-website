### 5th Patatrack Hackathon 28/01-01/02/2019 at CERN IdeaSquare

Are you addicted to coding and solving complex algorithmic problems?
The Patatrack team wants you!

The 5th Patatrack Hackathon will be held at CERN from the 28th of 
January to the 1st of February 2019. [IdeaSquare](https://ideasquare.web.cern.ch/)
will welcome us once again into its open, collaborative
and unconventional working spaces.

Come for the research, stay for the fun !

The goal is to design elegant and efficient solutions for challenging
problems sharing ideas and knowledge, away from emails, meetings and
other distractions.

This hackathon is open to all members of CMS, self-organised in small
groups of 2-5 people.
