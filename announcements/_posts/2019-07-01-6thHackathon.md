### 6th Patatrack Hackathon 01/07/2019-05/07/2019 at CERN IdeaSquare

Are you addicted to coding and solving complex algorithmic problems?
The Patatrack team wants you!

The 6th Patatrack Hackathon will be held at CERN from the 1st to the 5th of July 2019. [IdeaSquare](https://ideasquare.web.cern.ch/)
will welcome us once again into its open, collaborative
and unconventional working spaces.

Come for the research, stay for the fun !

The goal is to design elegant and efficient solutions for challenging
problems sharing ideas and knowledge, away from emails, meetings and
other distractions.

This hackathon is open to all members of CMS, self-organised in small
groups of 2-5 people.
