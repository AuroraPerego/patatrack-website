The International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics is one of the biggest events for software geeks like us. Its 24th Edition was just held from the 4th to the 8th of November 2019 in Adelaide, South Australia.
The Patatrack Team could not miss the opportunity to present some new and exciting results.

## New results from Patatrack Team

We are excited to announce new results from the physics and computational points of view concerning the Patatrack Pixel Reconstruction. 

### Physics results

The pixel reconstruction was improved by accounting for the geometric acceptance in the Pattern Recognition step and allowing a looser requirement on the number of hits belonging to a track. Instead of requiring at least four hits, now it is possible to go down to at least three hits per n-tuplet. 
This allows to improve the efficiency, as shown for single muon events without any pileup collision:

This new reconstruction was tested also for ttbar events with an average number of simultaneous proton-proton collisions of *50*.

From the computational point of view, the big news is that the same CUDA code can now execute with the same results on both GPU and CPU as shown in the plot below:

With all the ingredients above we were able to measure the throughput of both the GPU and CPU versions of the Patatrack Reconstruction when producing tracks from at least three (triplets) or four hits (quadruplets), and compare it against the CMS Pixel Reconstruction used for data taking in 2018.
We compare a full node powered by a dual socket Xeon Gold 6130 (2 Ã— 16 cores) running 4 CMSSW Processes, each with 16 threads, against an NVIDIA Tesla T4. For the GPU benchmark we measure the throughput in three configurations: when leaving the result on the GPU to be used by another GPU-based consumer (green), when copying back the result to the host in a Structure-of-Array data format (blue) and when converting the Structure-of-Arrays to the legacy data format (red).

The Patatrack Reconstruction running on a NVIDIA T4 can outperform the existing CMS reconstruction executed on an entire dual Xeon Gold "Skylake" node by a factor 2 when running quadruplets, and by 10% when running triplets (with much better physics performance).
The Patatrack reconstruction running on CPU can achieve the same computational performance of the CMS 2018 reconstruction, but using way more complex algorithms and producing much improved tracks.


### That's not all ...

Stay tuned for more results in the coming weeks !
