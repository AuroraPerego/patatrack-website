Following up on our last [blog entry]({{site.baseurl}}/announcements/2019/11/01/CHEP2019.html), here come more of the results that the Patatrack Team presented at the [24th International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics](http://chep2019.org/) in Adelaide, South Australia.


## Combining ARM Processors with NVIDIA GPUs

About one year ago, we started investigating the possibility to run the Patatrack Reconstruction on ARM+GPU. For this reason we acquired an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Developer Kit. It features an ARMv8.2 8-cores CPU together with a small slice of a Volta GPU (512 CUDA cores) in a low-power envelop. 
By using Linux Containers, we managed to get the CMS Software ([CMSSW](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/)) to run smoothly on this device. 
The throughput performance of the Patatrack Reconstruction are shown in the plot below:

In our benchmarks the Xavier Kit was configured in two modes:
* MAXN mode: no power limit for the envelop,
* max 30W mode: all CPU cores are active with reduced clock.

A Xavier can achieve about a fourth of the throughput of a T4 installed on a Intel Xeon CPU.

### World Premiere Patatrack Reconstruction running on ARM and NVIDIA V100

Thanks to a collaboration with NVIDIA and the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility, we were able to access and use for the first time a preproduction system, featuring two Cavium ThunderX2 CPUs and two NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs:
* 2 × Cavium ThunderX2 CN9975: 28 cores, 112 threads, 150-170 W power envelope;
* 2 × NVIDIA Tesla V100: 5120 CUDA cores, 250 W power envelope.

Software-wise, the system runs:
* CentOS 8.0 with Linux kernel 4.18.0-80 and GCC 8.3.1;
* pre-production CUDA 10.2.91 with NVIDIA drivers 435.17.01.

After building for ARMv8 and CentOS 8 the CMS Software with the GPU-accelerated Patatrack reconstruction, so it could run natively on this system, we compare the throughput in reconstructed events per second of the Cavium ThunderX2 against the following machine:
* 2 × Intel Xeon Silver 4114: 10 cores, 20 threads, 85 W power envelope;
* 1 × NVIDIA Tesla V100: 5120 CUDA cores, 250 W power envelope.

We run 4 CMSSW processes per GPU and in each job we measure the throughput for a different number of concurrent events (EDM Streams). 

At the plateau the Cavium ThunderX2 can process about *1737* events per second per GPU, while the Intel Silver 4114 with the single V100 reaches about *1800* events per second.

This is the first time an ARM based server is coupled to a discrete GPU. Performance-wise, the results are equivalent to an x86 solution, opening new and exciting opportunities for computing in High Energy Physics.
